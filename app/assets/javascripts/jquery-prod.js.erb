// Including jQuery in application.js causes errors when the AngularJS app is loaded in the
// Children's Council WordPress site, because this version of jQuery conflicts with a version
// included on the WordPress site. The current team did not put together the set of scripts
// loaded in application.js, so we are not yet clear on whether we actually need jQuery here.
// The major functions of the AngularJS app appear to still work without these requires. Since
// the error caused by the jQuery conflict is causing our end-to-end Cypress tests to fail,
// we are removing these requires in development so that the tests can pass in dev. Although the
// AngularJS app largely appears to work without these requires, we haven't yet had a chance to
// thoroughly investigate if there are any features that break without them, so we are leaving
// them in in production for now to be safe, until we can examine this further.
